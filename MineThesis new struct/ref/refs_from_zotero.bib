abstract = {We introduce the variational graph auto-encoder ({VGAE}), a framework for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data based on the variational auto-encoder ({VAE}). This model makes use of latent variables and is capable of learning interpretable latent representations for undirected graphs. We demonstrate this model using a graph convolutional network ({GCN}) encoder and a simple inner product decoder. Our model achieves competitive results on a link prediction task in citation networks. In contrast to most existing models for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data and link prediction, our model can naturally incorporate node features, which significantly improves predictive performance on a number of benchmark datasets.},

We applied this cost-based clustering algorithm to {PPI} networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans to identify and predict protein complexes. We have determined functional and graph-theoretic properties of true protein complexes from the {MIPS} database. Based on these properties, we defined filters to distinguish between identified network clusters and true protein complexes. {CONCLUSIONS}: Our application of the cost-based clustering algorithm provides an accurate and scalable method of detecting and predicting protein complexes within a {PPI} network.},

These modules encompass groups of genes or proteins involved in common elementary biological functions. One important and largely unsolved goal of functional genomics is the identification of functional modules from genomewide information, such as transcription profiles or protein interactions. To cope with the ever-increasing volume and complexity of protein interaction data (Bader et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2001;29:242–245; Xenarios et al., Nucleic Acids Res 2002;30:303–305), new automated approaches for pattern discovery in these densely connected interaction networks are required (Ravasz et al., Science 2002;297:1551–1555; Bader and Hogue, Nat Biotechnol 2002;20:991–997; Snel et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci {USA} 2002;99:5890–5895). In this study, we successfully isolate 1046 functional modules from the known protein interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae involving 8046 individual pair-wise interactions by using an entirely automated and unsupervised graph clustering algorithm. This systems biology approach is able to detect many well-known protein complexes or biological processes, without reference to any additional information. We use an extensive statistical validation procedure to establish the biological significance of the detected modules and explore this complex, hierarchical network of modular interactions from which pathways can be inferred.

In this study, we propose a novel method for assessing the compactness of local subnetworks by measuring the number of three node cliques. The present method detects each optimal cluster by growing a seed and maximizing the compactness function. To demonstrate the efficacy of the new proposed method, we evaluate its performance using five {PPI} networks on three reference sets of yeast protein complexes with five different measurements and compare the performance of the proposed method with four state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the protein complexes generated by the proposed method are of better quality than those generated by four classic methods. Therefore, the new proposed method is effective and useful for detecting protein complexes in {PPI} networks.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Biological systems can be modeled as complex network systems with many interactions between the components. These interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system. For example, the protein-protein interaction network is the physical basis of multiple cellular functions. One goal of emerging systems biology is to analyze very large complex biological networks such as protein-protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, and regulatory networks to identify functional modules and assign functions to certain components of the system. Network modules do not occur by chance, so identification of modules is likely to capture the biologically meaningful interactions in large-scale {PPI} data. Unfortunately, existing computer-based clustering methods developed to find those modules are either not so accurate or too slow. {RESULTS}: We devised a new methodology called {SCAN} (Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks) that can efficiently find clusters or functional modules in complex biological networks as well as hubs and outliers. More specifically, we demonstrated that we can find functional modules in complex networks and classify nodes into various roles based on their structures. In this study, we showed the effectiveness of our methodology using the budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) protein-protein interaction network. To validate our clustering results, we compared our clusters with the known functions of each protein. Our predicted functional modules achieved very high purity comparing with state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally the theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrated a linear running-time of the algorithm, which is the fastest approach for networks. {CONCLUSION}: We compare our algorithm with well-known modularity based clustering algorithm {CNM}. We successfully detect functional groups that are annotated with putative {GO} terms. Top-10 clusters with minimum p-value theoretically prove that newly proposed algorithm partitions network more accurately then {CNM}. Furthermore, manual interpretations of functional groups found by {SCAN} show superior performance over {CNM}.},

	abstract = {Many complex systems in nature and society can be described in terms of networks capturing the intricate web of connections among the units they are made of. A key question is how to interpret the global organization of such networks as the coexistence of their structural subunits (communities) associated with more highly interconnected parts. Identifying these a priori unknown building blocks (such as functionally related proteins, industrial sectors and groups of people) is crucial to the understanding of the structural and functional properties of networks. The existing deterministic methods used for large networks find separated communities, whereas most of the actual networks are made of highly overlapping cohesive groups of nodes. Here we introduce an approach to analysing the main statistical features of the interwoven sets of overlapping communities that makes a step towards uncovering the modular structure of complex systems. After defining a set of new characteristic quantities for the statistics of communities, we apply an efficient technique for exploring overlapping communities on a large scale. We find that overlaps are significant, and the distributions we introduce reveal universal features of networks. Our studies of collaboration, word-association and protein interaction graphs show that the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties.},

Recent advances in high-throughput experiments have provided large data sets of protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}). Many approaches, based on the assumption that complexes are dense subgraphs of {PPI} networks ({PINs} in short), have been proposed to predict complexes using graph clustering methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel from-function-to-interaction paradigm for protein complex detection. As proteins perform biological functions by forming complexes, we first cluster proteins using biology process ({BP}) annotations from gene ontology ({GO}). Then, we map the resulting protein clusters onto a {PPI} network ({PIN} in short), extract connected subgraphs consisting of clustered proteins from the {PPI} network and expand each connected subgraph with protein nodes that have rich links to the proteins in the subgraph. Such expanded subgraphs are taken as predicted complexes. We apply the proposed method (called {CPredictor}) to two {PPI} data sets of S. cerevisiae for predicting protein complexes. Experimental results show that {CPredictor} outperforms the existing methods. The outstanding precision of {CPredictor} proves that the from-function-to-interaction paradigm provides a new and effective way to computational detection of protein complexes.},

	abstract = {Protein complexes are fundamental for understanding principles of cellular organizations. As the sizes of protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) networks are increasing, accurate and fast protein complex prediction from these {PPI} networks can serve as a guide for biological experiments to discover novel protein complexes. However, it is not easy to predict protein complexes from {PPI} networks, especially in situations where the {PPI} network is noisy and still incomplete. Here, we study the use of indirect interactions between level-2 neighbors (level-2 interactions) for protein complex prediction. We know from previous work that proteins which do not interact but share interaction partners (level-2 neighbors) often share biological functions. We have proposed a method in which all direct and indirect interactions are first weighted using topological weight ({FS}-Weight), which estimates the strength of functional association. Interactions with low weight are removed from the network, while level-2 interactions with high weight are introduced into the interaction network. Existing clustering algorithms can then be applied to this modified network. We have also proposed a novel algorithm that searches for cliques in the modified network, and merge cliques to form clusters using a "partial clique merging" method. Experiments show that (1) the use of indirect interactions and topological weight to augment protein-protein interactions can be used to improve the precision of clusters predicted by various existing clustering algorithms; and (2) our complex-finding algorithm performs very well on interaction networks modified in this way. Since no other information except the original {PPI} network is used, our approach would be very useful for protein complex prediction, especially for prediction of novel protein complexes.},

The increasing mount of protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) data has enabled us to predict protein complexes. In spite of the advances in these computational approaches and experimental techniques, it is impossible to construct an absolutely reliable {PPI} network. Taking into account the reliability of interactions in the {PPI} network, we have constructed a weighted protein-protein interaction ({WPPI}) network, in which the reliability of each interaction is represented as a weight using the topology of the {PPI} network. As overlaps are likely to have biological importance, we proposed a novel method named {WN}-{PC} (weighted network-based method for predicting protein complexes) to predict overlapping protein complexes on the {WPPI} network. The proposed algorithm predicts neighborhood graphs with an aggregation coefficient over a threshold as candidate complexes, and binds attachment proteins to candidate complexes. Finally, we have filtered redundant complexes which overlap other complexes to a very high extent in comparison to their density and size. A comprehensive comparison between competitive algorithms and our {WN}-{PC} method has been made in terms of the F-measure, coverage rate, and P-value. We have applied {WN}-{PC} to two different yeast {PPI} data sets, one of which is a huge {PPI} network consisting of over 6000 proteins and 200 000 interactions. Experimental results show that {WN}-{PC} outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We think that our research may be helpful for other applications in {PPI} networks.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Protein complexes are important for understanding principles of cellular organization and function. High-throughput experimental techniques have produced a large amount of protein interactions, which makes it possible to predict protein complexes from protein–protein interaction ({PPI}) networks. However, protein interaction data produced by high-throughput experiments are often associated with high false positive and false negative rates, which makes it difficult to predict complexes accurately.Results: We use an iterative scoring method to assign weight to protein pairs, and the weight of a protein pair indicates the reliability of the interaction between the two proteins. We develop an algorithm called {CMC} (clustering-based on maximal cliques) to discover complexes from the weighted {PPI} network. {CMC} first generates all the maximal cliques from the {PPI} networks, and then removes or merges highly overlapped clusters based on their interconnectivity. We studied the performance of {CMC} and the impact of our iterative scoring method on {CMC}. Our results show that: (i) the iterative scoring method can improve the performance of {CMC} considerably; (ii) the iterative scoring method can effectively reduce the impact of random noise on the performance of {CMC}; (iii) the iterative scoring method can also improve the performance of other protein complex prediction methods and reduce the impact of random noise on their performance; and (iv) {CMC} is an effective approach to protein complex prediction from protein interaction network.Contact:liugm@comp.nus.edu.{sgSupplementary} information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

In a protein assocation network modules appear as groups of densely interconnected nodes, also called communities or clusters. These modules often overlap with each other and form a network of their own, in which nodes (links) represent the modules (overlaps). We introduce {CFinder}, a fast program locating and visualizing overlapping, densely interconnected groups of nodes in undirected graphs, and allowing the user to easily navigate between the original graph and the web of these groups. We show that in gene (protein) association networks {CFinder} can be used to predict the function(s) of a single protein and to discover novel modules. {CFinder} is also very efficient for locating the cliques of large sparse graphs.Availability: {CFinder} (for Windows, Linux and Macintosh) and its manual can be downloaded from .Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available on Bioinformatics online.Contact:cfinder@angel.elte.hu},

	abstract = {Protein complexes are one of the keys to studying the behavior of a cell system. Many biological functions are carried out by protein complexes. During the past decade, the main strategy used to identify protein complexes from high-throughput network data has been to extract near-cliques or highly dense subgraphs from a single protein–protein interaction ({PPI}) network. Although experimental {PPI} data have increased significantly over recent years, most {PPI} networks still have many false positive interactions and false negative edge loss due to the limitations of high-throughput experiments. In particular, the false negative errors restrict the search space of such conventional protein complex identification approaches. Thus, it has become one of the most challenging tasks in systems biology to automatically identify protein complexes.In this study, we propose a new algorithm, {NEOComplex} ({NECC}- and Ortholog-based Complex identification by multiple network alignment), which integrates functional orthology information that can be obtained from different types of multiple network alignment ({MNA}) approaches to expand the search space of protein complex detection. As part of our approach, we also define a new edge clustering coefficient ({NECC}) to assign weights to interaction edges in {PPI} networks so that protein complexes can be identified more accurately. The {NECC} is based on the intuition that there is functional information captured in the common neighbors of the common neighbors as well. Our results show that our algorithm outperforms well-known protein complex identification tools in a balance between precision and recall on three eukaryotic species: human, yeast, and fly. As a result of {MNAs} of the species, the proposed approach can tolerate edge loss in {PPI} networks and even discover sparse protein complexes which have traditionally been a challenge to predict.http://acolab.ie.nthu.edu.tw/bionetwork/{NEOComplexSupplementary} data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Background In recent years, many protein complex mining algorithms, such as classical clique percolation ({CPM}) method and markov clustering ({MCL}) algorithm, have developed for protein-protein interaction network. However, most of the available algorithms primarily concentrate on mining dense protein subgraphs as protein complexes, failing to take into account the inherent organizational structure within protein complexes. Thus, there is a critical need to study the possibility of mining protein complexes using the topological information hidden in edges. Moreover, the recent massive experimental analyses reveal that protein complexes have their own intrinsic organization. Methods Inspired by the formation process of cliques of the complex social network and the centrality-lethality rule, we propose a new protein complex mining algorithm called Multistage Kernel Extension ({MKE}) algorithm, integrating the idea of critical proteins recognition in the Protein- Protein Interaction ({PPI}) network,. {MKE} first recognizes the nodes with high degree as the first level kernel of protein complex, and then adds the weighted best neighbour node of the first level kernel into the current kernel to form the second level kernel of the protein complex. This process is repeated, extending the current kernel to form protein complex. In the end, overlapped protein complexes are merged to form the final protein complex set. Results Here {MKE} has better accuracy compared with the classical clique percolation method and markov clustering algorithm. {MKE} also performs better than the classical clique percolation method both on Gene Ontology semantic similarity and co-localization enrichment and can effectively identify protein complexes with biological significance in the {PPI} network.},

Recently, two genome-wide applications of tandem affinity purification ({TAP}) in yeast have increased significantly the available information on interactions in complexes. Several approaches have been developed to predict protein complexes from these measurements, which generally depend heavily on additional training data in the form of known complexes. In this article, we present an unsupervised algorithm for the identification of protein complexes which is independent of the availability of such additional complex information. Based on a Bootstrap approach, we calculate intuitive confidence scores for interactions more accurate than all other published scoring methods and predict complexes with the same quality as the best supervised predictions. Although there are considerable differences between the Bootstrap and the best published predictions, the set of consistently identified complexes is more than four times as large as for complexes derived from one data set only. Our results illustrate that meaningful and reliable complexes can be determined from the purification experiments alone. As a consequence, the approach presented in this article is easily applicable to large-scale {TAP} experiments for any species even if few complexes are already known.},

Using mutants of T antigen known to be defective in binding to p53, we demonstrate that the two-hybrid system is more sensitive than immunoprecipitation in the detection of weak interactions. We mutagenized the murine p53 gene and screened in the yeast assay for decreased reporter gene expression indicative of the failure of p53 to bind T antigen. This screen identified 34 p53 mutants, almost all of which contain at least one mutation in the conserved domains frequently found mutated in human cancers.

	abstract = {Peptide recognition modules mediate many protein-protein interactions critical for the assembly of macromolecular complexes. Complete genome sequences have revealed thousands of these domains, requiring improved methods for identifying their physiologically relevant binding partners. We have developed a strategy combining computational prediction of interactions from phage-display ligand consensus sequences with large-scale two-hybrid physical interaction tests. Application to yeast {SH}3 domains generated a phage-display network containing 394 interactions among 206 proteins and a two-hybrid network containing 233 interactions among 145 proteins. Graph theoretic analysis identified 59 highly likely interactions common to both networks. Las17 (Bee1), a member of the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein ({WASP}) family of actin-assembly proteins, showed multiple {SH}3 interactions, many of which were confirmed in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation.},

	abstract = {The detection of temporal protein complexes would be a great aid in furthering our knowledge of the dynamic features and molecular mechanism in cell life activities. Inspired by the idea of that the tighter a protein's neighbors inside a module connect, the greater the possibility that the protein belongs to the module, we propose a novel clustering algorithm {CNC} (Clustering based on Neighbor Closeness) and apply it to the time course protein interaction networks ({TCPINs}) to detect temporal protein complexes. Our novel algorithm has better performance on identifying protein complexes than five state-of-the-art algorithms—Hunter, {MCODE}, {CFinder}, {SPICI}, and {ClusterONE}—in terms of matching degree and accuracy metric, meanwhile it obtains many protein complexes with strong biological significance.},

To make up for this lack of protein complex data, we explore the mining of existing protein interaction graphs for protein complexes. This paper proposes a novel graph mining algorithm to detect the dense neighborhoods (highly connected regions) in an interaction graph which may correspond to protein complexes. Our algorithm first locates local cliques for each graph vertex (protein) and then merge the detected local cliques according to their affinity to form maximal dense regions. We present experimental results with yeast protein interaction data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Compared with other existing techniques, our predicted complexes can match or overlap significantly better with the known protein complexes in the {MIPS} benchmark database. Novel protein complexes were also predicted to help biologists in their search for new protein complexes.},

Vulnerable populations including young children and elderly and immunocompromised people often require hospitalization and may die. However, no efficient vaccine for {NoVs} exists because of their variable genome sequences. This study investigates the infection processes in protein-protein interactions between hosts and {NoVs}. Protein-protein interactions were collected from related Pfam {NoV} domains. The related Pfam domains were accumulated incrementally from the protein domain interaction database. To examine the influence of domain intimacy, the 7 {NoV} domains were grouped by depth. The number of domain-domain interactions increased exponentially as the depth increased. Many protein-protein interactions were relevant; therefore, cloud techniques were used to analyze data because of their computational capacity. The infection relationship between hosts and {NoVs} should be used in clinical applications and drug design.},

	abstract = {Protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}) play a crucial role in various biological processes. To better comprehend the pathogenesis and treatments of various diseases, it is necessary to learn the detail of these interactions. However, the current experimental method still has many false-positive and false-negative problems. Computational prediction of protein-protein interaction has become a more important prediction method which can overcome the obstacles of the experimental method. In this work, we proposed a novel computational domain-based method for {PPI} prediction, and an {SVM} model for the prediction was built based on the physicochemical property of the domain. The outcomes of {SVM} and the domain-domain score were used to construct the prediction model for protein-protein interaction. The predicted results demonstrated the domain-based research can enhance the ability to predict protein interactions.},
