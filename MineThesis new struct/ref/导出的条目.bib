	abstract = {Advancing research in the emerging field of deep graph learning requires new tools to support tensor computation over graphs. In this paper, we present the design principles and implementation of Deep Graph Library ({DGL}). {DGL} distills the computational patterns of {GNNs} into a few generalized sparse tensor operations suitable for extensive parallelization. By advocating graph as the central programming abstraction, {DGL} can perform optimizations transparently. By cautiously adopting a framework-neutral design, {DGL} allows users to easily port and leverage the existing components across multiple deep learning frameworks. Our evaluation shows that {DGL} significantly outperforms other popular {GNN}-oriented frameworks in both speed and memory consumption over a variety of benchmarks and has little overhead for small scale workloads.},
