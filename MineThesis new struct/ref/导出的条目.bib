	abstract = {We introduce the variational graph auto-encoder ({VGAE}), a framework for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data based on the variational auto-encoder ({VAE}). This model makes use of latent variables and is capable of learning interpretable latent representations for undirected graphs. We demonstrate this model using a graph convolutional network ({GCN}) encoder and a simple inner product decoder. Our model achieves competitive results on a link prediction task in citation networks. In contrast to most existing models for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data and link prediction, our model can naturally incorporate node features, which significantly improves predictive performance on a number of benchmark datasets.},
